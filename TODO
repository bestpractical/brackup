-- fix up docs, move all to POD, in relevant classes.

-- tool to clean digestcache, based on prefixes, looking for files that no longer
   exist or have new mtimes, etc?  or keep track of "last used" date
   field in the digestcache and just delete things that are too old?
   but then no longer just a dictionary.  SQLite would work, but we'd ideally
   like lots of dumber cache mechanisms.  maybe a ->clean method is optional?
   then a memcached backend/etc doesn't have to use it.

-- ionice stuff.  network nice stuff.

-- leaking 3 /tmp files after each run

-- make tests pass without 'noatime' mount option

-- --ignore-debian-files option (if managed by a package management
   system (and not an unmodified conffile), don't back it up)

-- proactively clean temp files, as aborts/segvs in middle can leave
   tens of thousands of files in /tmp, filling it up.  (report from
   kvance)  (THIS MIGHT BE FIXED ALREADY)

-- reuse tempfiles in Chunk.pm as Restore.pm does

-- restoring from existing config file.

-- restoring subsets of files

-- better test coverage.  currently at 84%.  should ignore
   test coverage of test modules.  move Brackup::Test to
   t/lib/ probably

-- Amazon target doesn't support restoring yet.

-- Amazon target should complain if you don't have an exist_cache
   configured (otherwise it's damn slow)

-- default config written out should include exist cache line for
   Amazon too

-- should do TODOs in code.  :)
