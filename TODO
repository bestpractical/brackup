-- make tests pass without 'noatime' mount option

-- --ignore-debian-files option (if managed by a package management
   system (and not an unmodified conffile), don't back it up)

-- proactively clean temp files, as aborts/segvs in middle can leave
   tens of thousands of files in /tmp, filling it up.  (report from
   kvance)

-- reuse tempfiles in Chunk.pm as Restore.pm does

-- restoring from existing config file.

-- restoring subsets of files

-- better test coverage.  currently at 84%.  should ignore
   test coverage of test modules.  move Brackup::Test to
   t/lib/ probably

-- Amazon target doesn't support restoring yet.

-- Amazon target should complain if you don't have an exist_cache
   configured (otherwise it's damn slow)

-- default config written out should include exist cache line for
   Amazon too

-- should do TODOs in code.  :)
