  - new --du-stats to command to act like the du(1) command, but
    based on a root in brackup.conf, and skipping ignored directories.
    good to let you know how big a backup will be.

  - walk directories smarter: jump over directories early which ignore
    patterns show as never matching.

  - deal w/ encryption better:  tell chunks when the backup target
    will need data, so it can forget cached digest/backlength
    ahead of time w/o errors/warnings later.

  - start of stats code (to give stats after a backup).  not done.

0.91 (sep 29 2006)
  - there's now a restore command (brackup-restore)

  - amazon restore support

  - use gpg --trust-model=always for new gpg that is more paranoid.

  - mostly usable.  some more switches would be nice later.  real
    1.00 release will come after few weeks/months of testing/tweaks.

0.80
