  - cleanups, strictness

  - don't upload meta files when in dry-run mode

  - update amazon target support to work again, with the new inventory
    database support (now separated from the old digest database)

  - merge in the refactoring branch, in which a lot of long-standing
    pet peeves in the design were rethought/redone.

  - make decryption --use-agent and --batch, and help out if env not set
    and gpg-agent probably not running

  - support putting .meta files besides .chunk files on the Target
    to enable reconstructing the digest database in the future, should
    it get lost.  also start to flesh out per-chunk digests, which
    would enable backing up large databases (say, InnoDB tablespaces) where 
    large chunks of the file never change.

  - new --du-stats to command to act like the du(1) command, but
    based on a root in brackup.conf, and skipping ignored directories.
    good to let you know how big a backup will be.

  - walk directories smarter: jump over directories early which ignore
    patterns show as never matching.

  - deal w/ encryption better:  tell chunks when the backup target
    will need data, so it can forget cached digest/backlength
    ahead of time w/o errors/warnings later.

  - start of stats code (to give stats after a backup).  not done.

0.91 (sep 29 2006)
  - there's now a restore command (brackup-restore)

  - amazon restore support

  - use gpg --trust-model=always for new gpg that is more paranoid.

  - mostly usable.  some more switches would be nice later.  real
    1.00 release will come after few weeks/months of testing/tweaks.

0.80
  - restore works

  - lot more tests

  - notable bug fix with encrypted backups.  metafiles could have wrong sizes.

0.71
  - first release to CPAN, didn't support restoring yet.
    also didn't have a Changes file
