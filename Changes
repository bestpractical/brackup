  - brackup-target tool, to list/get brackup files from a target,
    and in the future do garbage collection on no-longer-referenced
    chunks (once a command exists to delete a brackup file from a target)

  - stop leaking temp files

  - doc fixes/additions

1.02 (may 22, 2007)

  - support for merging little files together into big chunks
    on the backup target.  aka "tail packing".  requires no changes
    to target drivers.  this should speed backups, as less network
    round-trips.  will also be cheaper, once Amazon starts charging
    per number of HTTP requests in June.

  - improved docs

1.01 (may 21, 2007)

  - lot of new/updated docs

1.00 (may 21, 2007)

  RELEASE NOTE: The author/maintainer of Brackup is finally happy now,
    and has 40 GB of data stored on Amazon, encrypted.  You can
    trust this now.  And the file formats aren't changing (or aren't
    changing without being compatible with old *.brackup/Amazon
    formats...)

  - track in meta header the default (most often occuring) modes for
    files and directories, then don't list those for each file/dir
    with those mode.  saves on disk space on *.brackup files

  - support 'noatime = 1' option on a source root, because atimes are
    often useless, so waste of space in metafile.

  - rename digestdb back to digestcache, now that it's purely a cache
    again.

  - fix memory leak in case where chunk exists on target, but local
    digest database was lost, and digest of chunk had to be recomputed.
    in that case, the raw chunk was kept in memory until the end
    (which it likely would never reach, accumulating GBs of RAM)

  - make PositionedChunk use the digest cache (which I guess was
    re-fleshed out in the big refactor but never used...).  so
    iterative backups are fast again... no re-reading all files
    in, blowing away all caches.

  - clean up old, dead code in Amazon target (the old inventory db which
    is now an official part of the core, and in the Target base class)

  - retry PUTs to Amazon on failure, a few times, pausing in-between,
    in case it was a transient error, as seems to happen occasionally

  - halve number of stats when walking backup root

  - cleanups, strictness

  - don't upload meta files when in dry-run mode

  - update amazon target support to work again, with the new inventory
    database support (now separated from the old digest database)

  - merge in the refactoring branch, in which a lot of long-standing
    pet peeves in the design were rethought/redone.

  - make decryption --use-agent and --batch, and help out if env not set
    and gpg-agent probably not running

  - support putting .meta files besides .chunk files on the Target
    to enable reconstructing the digest database in the future, should
    it get lost.  also start to flesh out per-chunk digests, which
    would enable backing up large databases (say, InnoDB tablespaces) where 
    large chunks of the file never change.

  - new --du-stats to command to act like the du(1) command, but
    based on a root in brackup.conf, and skipping ignored directories.
    good to let you know how big a backup will be.

  - walk directories smarter: jump over directories early which ignore
    patterns show as never matching.

  - deal w/ encryption better:  tell chunks when the backup target
    will need data, so it can forget cached digest/backlength
    ahead of time w/o errors/warnings later.

  - start of stats code (to give stats after a backup).  not done.

0.91 (sep 29 2006)
  - there's now a restore command (brackup-restore)

  - amazon restore support

  - use gpg --trust-model=always for new gpg that is more paranoid.

  - mostly usable.  some more switches would be nice later.  real
    1.00 release will come after few weeks/months of testing/tweaks.

0.80
  - restore works

  - lot more tests

  - notable bug fix with encrypted backups.  metafiles could have wrong sizes.

0.71
  - first release to CPAN, didn't support restoring yet.
    also didn't have a Changes file
